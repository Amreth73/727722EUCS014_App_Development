Guess the over dependence on the airline crew who stay there in quite huge numbers make the food too very North Indian -would rather have a good spread of north malabar cuisine what with the best fresh fish/sea food available in plenty !!! beats me why they do this . The people and the resort in itself makes up for the slight let down in the kitchen. The Ayurveda spa is a treat and a great experience - a must try.Overall a wonderful experience.",
